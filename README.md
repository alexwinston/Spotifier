# Spotifier
Mac app that cleverly uses the libspotify API to download songs, it does this in realtime though so it is slow

Notes
-----
This app requires a login and Spotify URI, please use this simply as a learning tool.  It was fun to reverse engineer the API and try and think outside the box for a way to to save the audio.
